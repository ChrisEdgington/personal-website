# Personal website for Chris Edgington

This is based off of the Spolight template from Tailwind UI.

## Dev

For local dev:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To deploy, merge `main` to `prod` or push directly to `prod` branch.

## Hosting

The artifacts from the build get uploaded by the github action to some github spot which then uses them to hose the site via github-pages.

The domain cedgington.dev is configured at google domains as a CNAME to chrisedgington.github.io
